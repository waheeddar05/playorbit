/**
 * The custom OTP session token — signed on the WhatsApp login and read by
 * every gate that decides whether someone is signed in.
 *
 * Signed and verified with `jose`, NOT `jsonwebtoken`, and that choice is
 * load-bearing rather than cosmetic. `src/middleware.ts` is the app's edge
 * middleware: it runs in Vercel's Edge Runtime, where Node's `crypto` module
 * does not exist. `jsonwebtoken` reaches `crypto.createHmac` through `jws`,
 * so on the edge every `verify()` threw and the old wrapper's `catch` turned
 * that into `null` — "not signed in" for every WhatsApp user, on every
 * request, while `src/app/page.tsx` (Node runtime, same helper, same cookie)
 * read the same token successfully and redirected them to /slots. The two
 * runtimes disagreeing about one cookie is an infinite / <-> /slots redirect
 * loop, which is exactly what shipped on 2026-09-02.
 *
 * `jose` is built on Web Crypto, so it behaves identically in the Edge
 * Runtime, in Node serverless functions and in tests. Anything that decides
 * "is this request authenticated" must stay on it.
 *
 * The format is unchanged (HS256 over the same `JWT_SECRET`), so tokens
 * issued by the previous `jsonwebtoken` implementation keep verifying and
 * nobody is signed out by this change.
