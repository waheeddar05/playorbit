 * The OTP session cookie — one definition, so the route that issues it and

 * `sameSite` is **lax**, not strict, and that is a deliberate correction.
 * Strict withholds the cookie on any top-level navigation that started on
 * another site: a link tapped in WhatsApp, an Instagram bio link, a QR code,
 * a search result, a PWA launch. `src/app/page.tsx` then renders for a
 * signed-out visitor and the user — who is signed in, and whose very next
 * same-site fetch proves it — is shown the landing page instead of their
 * booking screen. Lax still withholds the cookie from cross-site POSTs,
 * which is the CSRF protection that actually matters here.
