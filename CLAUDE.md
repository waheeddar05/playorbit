# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

PlayOrbit (`abca-booking`) is a cricket practice booking platform built with Next.js 16 (App Router). Users book sessions on bowling machines (Gravity, Yantra, Leverage Indoor/Outdoor) across pitch types (Astro, Cement, Natural), with online payment via Razorpay or cash. Roles: USER, ADMIN, MODERATOR, OPERATOR, COACH, SIDEARM_STAFF. Deployed on Vercel as a PWA with Android TWA support.

**MODERATOR** is a restricted admin (both a `UserRole` and a `MembershipRole`). A moderator runs the day-to-day floor — Dashboard, Bookings, Slots, Packages, Ledger — and nothing else. Blocked outright: **Users, Settings, My Center, Operators, Sidearm, Personal Coach, Ground Staff, Offers**. They also cannot cancel/refund bookings or reassign booking staff, and cannot mutate packages (create/edit/activate, user-package changes, or assign). Staff management is full-admin only: `requireCenterStaffManagerForCenter` (`src/lib/adminAuth.ts`) is now just an alias of `requireCenterAdminForCenter`, and the Offers / Operators / recurring-discount routes reject on the `isModerator` flag. Enforced in the middleware (`/admin` path blocklist), the API guards, and the admin UI (`layout.tsx` + `AdminMobileNav`). Detect it via `isCenterModerator(user, centerId)` (`src/lib/auth.ts`) on the backend or the `isModerator` flag from `requireCenterAdmin`; on the client use `useAdminRole()` (`src/lib/useAdminRole.ts`).

The self-service exception stands: a user whose own `UserRole` is `SIDEARM_SPECIALIST` or `COACH` still reaches `/admin/sidearm` / `/admin/coach` to manage their own availability.

**Multi-center**: The system is being evolved from single-center to multi-center. Most domain data is center-scoped via a `centerId` FK. ABCA's seeded center ID is `ctr_abca`; new centers (e.g. Toplay) are added via the super admin UI. Machines, payment config (per-center Razorpay), admins/operators, pricing, and policies are configurable per center. See "Multi-Center Architecture" section below.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Next.js 16.1.4** (App Router, React 19, Turbopack)
- **Prisma 6** + PostgreSQL (Supabase/Vercel Postgres)
- **NextAuth 4** (mounted for legacy sessions only, no provider registered) + custom JWT — login is WhatsApp OTP
- **Razorpay** for payments, **Zod** for validation
- **Tailwind CSS v4**, **Lucide React** icons
- **Vitest** + React Testing Library + jsdom

### Auth — WhatsApp OTP only

**Login is WhatsApp OTP. There is no other way in.** Two steps, both public because they *are* the front door:

1. `POST /api/auth/otp/request` — validates the number, finds-or-creates the account keyed on `mobileNumber`, issues a 6-digit code and sends it.
2. `POST /api/auth/otp/verify` — checks the code, flips `mobileVerified`, and sets the `token` cookie (custom JWT, `src/lib/jwt.ts`). Receiving the code **is** proof of the number, so a WhatsApp login is verified by construction and never meets the `/verify-mobile` gate.

`signToken`/`verifyToken` in `src/lib/jwt.ts` are **async** and built on `jose`, not `jsonwebtoken` — see the Edge Runtime note under Middleware for why that is not interchangeable. The token format is unchanged (HS256 over `JWT_SECRET`).

The cookie's attributes live in `src/lib/session-cookie.ts` — `setSessionCookie` / `clearSessionCookie` — so the route that issues it and the route that clears it cannot drift. It is **SameSite=Lax on purpose**: Strict withholds the cookie on any top-level navigation that started on another site (a link tapped in WhatsApp, an Instagram bio link, a QR code, a search result, a PWA launch), so `src/app/page.tsx` rendered for a signed-out visitor and a signed-in user was shown the landing page instead of their booking screen. Lax still withholds it from cross-site POSTs, which is the CSRF protection that matters. Do not tighten it back.

`POST /api/auth/logout` clears that cookie. It has to be server-side: the cookie is `httpOnly`, so the `document.cookie = 'token=…'` that the navbar and staff layout used to run never removed anything and left users signed in through a "Sign out" they'd already been shown.

**Delivery** lives in `src/lib/otp-delivery.ts` (`issueAndSendOtp`), shared with `/api/auth/whatsapp/send-otp`: an approved WhatsApp auth template first, then the `playorbit_account_pin` utility template, then SMS as a backstop — a BSP outage must not lock everyone out of the only login. A send that reached nobody deletes its own OTP row so an outage can't burn the user's budget.

**Three limits guard the front door**, and all of them matter because `/api/auth/otp/request` is public, creates accounts, and spends money per call:
- **3 codes / 10 min per account** — the ordinary abuse case.
- **`OTP_GLOBAL_PER_MINUTE` (default 30) platform-wide** — the per-account limit is keyed on the account, so an attacker cycling fresh numbers never trips it while every call bills a WhatsApp template or an SMS. This is the spend circuit breaker.
- **`OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default 5) wrong guesses per code**, counted on `Otp.attempts`; the code is burned on the last allowed miss. A 6-digit code with no attempt cap is fully guessable inside its TTL.

**Google is off.** `authOptions` registers no provider unless `GOOGLE_LOGIN_ENABLED=true`, so no new Google session can be created (including via `/api/auth/signin/google`). NextAuth stays mounted so sessions issued before the cutover keep working until they expire instead of logging everyone out mid-booking, and `getAuthenticatedUser` still reads them.

> **Migration risk, know this before touching it:** a Google account is keyed on **email**, a WhatsApp login on **mobileNumber**. An account created by Google that never linked a number is unreachable by phone — its owner signing in with WhatsApp lands on a *fresh* account, leaving bookings, wallet, packages and center memberships on the orphaned row. Admins can't set another user's `mobileNumber` (`PATCH /api/admin/users` doesn't accept it), so the only recovery is `GOOGLE_LOGIN_ENABLED=true` → sign in → link the number on `/verify-mobile`.

**Client-side session: use `useCurrentUser()`, never `useSession()`.** `src/lib/current-user.tsx` reads `GET /api/user/profile`, which goes through `getAuthenticatedUser` and therefore sees both mechanisms. `useSession()` only ever sees NextAuth, so every gate written against it reports "signed out" for a WhatsApp user — i.e. for everyone. That was not hypothetical: it collapsed the admin sidebar to zero links, hid the super-admin pages from super admins, locked `/admin/maintenance` and `/admin/db-cleanup` behind an email match that a phone-only account doesn't have, and silently charged free users and super admins on the slots page. `useAdminRole()` reads it too. `useSession()` is now legitimate in exactly two places — `MobileNumberCheck` and `/verify-mobile`, both NextAuth-specific — plus deciding *which* sign-out to run.

**Every account needs a name asked for, because WhatsApp does not supply one.** Google sign-in used to; `/api/auth/otp/request` creates accounts with `name: null`, and `BookingCard` then renders "Unknown" — which is what centre staff read off the floor list. `src/components/NamePrompt.tsx` is mounted once in the root layout, reads `useCurrentUser()`, and blocks with a single field whenever a signed-in account has no name. It lives there rather than as a step inside `LoginModal` so that one implementation catches both new signups and every nameless account created since the cutover. It writes through `PATCH /api/user/profile`, and both ends validate with `normalizeDisplayName` (`src/lib/display-name.ts`) so the form and the API cannot disagree.

`getAuthenticatedUser(req)` in `src/lib/auth.ts` is the universal auth helper for API routes — checks NextAuth first, falls back to OTP token, returns `{ id, name, role, email, isSuperAdmin, isFreeUser, isSpecialUser, mobileVerified, centerIds, centerMemberships }` or `null`. `centerMemberships` is the list of `{ centerId, role }` rows for the user; use it (or the helpers `canAccessCenter`, `hasMembershipRole`, `adminCenterIds`) to enforce per-center access in API routes.

### Middleware (`src/middleware.ts`)
- Protects all routes except explicit public paths (/, /login, /otp, /api/auth, static assets). `/login` is a bare redirect to `/`; the login form is the modal on the landing page (`src/components/LoginModal.tsx`).
- Redirects logged-in users from /login, /otp to /slots (or /operator for OPERATOR role)
- The `/verify-mobile` gate keys off the **NextAuth** token only, so it catches legacy Google sessions with no linked number and never a WhatsApp login.
- Enforces role-based access: `/admin/*` requires ADMIN, `/operator/*` requires OPERATOR or ADMIN
- Checks maintenance mode via internal API call; super admin and allowlisted emails bypass

> **Middleware runs in the Edge Runtime — no Node built-ins.** Everything it imports, transitively, must work on Web Crypto and `fetch` alone. Turbopack does **not** fail the build on a Node-only import: it swaps the module for a stub that throws only when touched, so the breakage ships and then fires per-request in production.
>
> That is precisely the 2026-09-02 login outage. `@/lib/jwt` used `jsonwebtoken` (→ `jws` → `crypto.createHmac`), so `verifyToken` threw on the edge and its `catch` returned `null`: middleware read every WhatsApp session as *signed out* and bounced it from `/slots` to `/`, while `src/app/page.tsx` — Node runtime, same helper, same cookie — read it fine and redirected back to `/slots`. An infinite redirect loop; nobody could log in. Unit tests run in Node, where the import works, so none of them caught it.
>
> `src/lib/jwt.ts` is `jose` (Web Crypto) and both `signToken` and `verifyToken` are **async**. `src/__tests__/middleware-edge-safety.test.ts` walks middleware's import graph and fails on any package not on its edge-safe list — extend that list only after confirming the package really runs on the edge.
>
> The same failure shape has a second source: two readers of one cookie disagreeing about the *secret*. `src/lib/auth-secret.ts` is the single place `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` is read; use it rather than reaching for `process.env` again.

### Pricing Engine (`src/lib/pricing.ts`)
Dynamic pricing based on machine ID, pitch type, ball type, and time slab (morning/evening). Consecutive slot bookings get a discounted rate. Config stored in Policy table as `PRICING_CONFIG` JSON, with `DEFAULT_PRICING_CONFIG` as fallback. Yantra has premium pricing tiers. Key functions: `getSlotPrice()`, `getConsecutivePrice()`, `calculateNewPricing()`.

### Machine & Pitch Config (`src/lib/constants.ts`)
Four machines defined in `MACHINES` record: GRAVITY, YANTRA (leather), LEVERAGE_INDOOR, LEVERAGE_OUTDOOR (tennis). Each has ball type, category, and compatible pitch types. Machine-pitch compatibility can be overridden via `MACHINE_PITCH_CONFIG` policy key.

### Database Schema (`prisma/schema.prisma`)
Key models: Center, CenterMembership, Resource, MachineType, Machine, CenterPolicy, User, Booking, Slot, Package, UserPackage, PackageBooking, Payment, BlockedSlot, OperatorAssignment, CashPaymentUser, Policy, Notification, Otp. Booking uniqueness: `[centerId, date, startTime, machineId, pitchType]` (center-scoped). Payment tracks Razorpay order/payment/signature/refund lifecycle.

### Policy System (with center override)
Two tables:
- `Policy` — global defaults (key-value), unchanged from before.
- `CenterPolicy` — per-center overrides, unique on `(centerId, key)`.

Resolution: center → global → code default. Use `getPolicyValue(key, centerId, fallback?)` / `getPolicyJson(...)` / `isPolicyEnabled(...)` from `src/lib/policy.ts`. Existing global feature flags (`PAYMENT_GATEWAY_ENABLED`, `SLOT_PAYMENT_REQUIRED`, `PRICING_CONFIG`, `TIME_SLAB_CONFIG`, `MACHINE_PITCH_CONFIG`, etc.) keep working unchanged; per-center overrides can be added without code changes by inserting `CenterPolicy` rows.

`policy-cache.ts` (`getCachedPolicy`) is the legacy global-only helper. Prefer the new `policy.ts` resolver in any new code.

### Booking notice (`BOOKING_NOTICE`)

A must-read facility rule rendered **in red** wherever the user meets a booking confirmation: the `ConfirmDialog`'s `notice` prop (louder than the existing amber `warning` prop — `warning` is advice about the booking, `notice` is a rule the player has to act on) on both `ResourceSlotsPage` and `MatchPracticePanel`, plus a banner at the top of `/bookings`, since the booking flow redirects there and the dialog is gone by the time the confirmed booking is read.

Text resolves center → global → `DEFAULT_BOOKING_NOTICE` (`src/lib/client-constants.ts`, defaults to the TopPlay outside-shoes rule) and reaches the client via `bookingNotice` on `/api/payments/config`. **A stored empty string means "no notice"** and is a real value — only an unset policy falls back to the default, so a center without a shoe rule turns it off by saving blank. Edited on Admin → Configuration → **Booking Notice** (with a live red preview), saved by that page's single Save button.

Not carried on WhatsApp: `booking_detail` is a Meta-approved fixed-param template, so adding a line would need re-approval.

### API Route Pattern
All API routes are in `src/app/api/`. Standard pattern for protected, center-scoped routes:
```typescript
import { getAuthenticatedUser, canAccessCenter, hasMembershipRole } from '@/lib/auth';
import { resolveCurrentCenter } from '@/lib/centers';

const user = await getAuthenticatedUser(req);
if (!user) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });

const center = await resolveCurrentCenter(req, user);
if (!center) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'No center' }, { status: 400 });

// Always scope DB queries by centerId, e.g. prisma.booking.findMany({ where: { centerId: center.id, ... } })
// For admin-only routes:
if (!hasMembershipRole(user, center.id, 'ADMIN')) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Forbidden' }, { status: 403 });
}
```

### Directory Layout
- `src/app/api/` — API routes (auth, bookings, slots, packages, payments, admin/*, operator/*)
- `src/app/admin/` — Admin dashboard pages
- `src/app/operator/` — Operator dashboard
- `src/app/slots/`, `src/app/bookings/`, `src/app/packages/`, `src/app/shop/`, `src/app/profile/` — User-facing pages
- `src/components/` — React components (Navbar, BookingForm, slots/, ui/)
- `src/hooks/` — Custom hooks (useSlots, usePackages, usePricing)
- `src/lib/` — Core business logic (auth, pricing, prisma, razorpay, constants, schemas, sms, time, jwt, api-client)
- `src/lib/__tests__/` — Unit tests
- `prisma/` — Schema and migrations
- `scripts/` — Admin utilities
- `public/` — PWA assets (sw.js, manifest.json, icons/)

## PWA (`public/manifest.json`, `public/sw.js`)

`start_url` is **`/slots`**, not `/` — reopening the installed app should land on the booking screen, and a signed-out launch is bounced to `/` by the middleware anyway. `id` stays `/` so existing installs update in place instead of being treated as a new app.

**The service worker must never handle navigations** (`if (request.mode === 'navigate') return;`). Every HTML document here depends on who is asking — `/` redirects a signed-in user to `/slots` and renders the landing page for everyone else — so a cached document replayed to the same browser in a different auth state shows a signed-in user the marketing page, and it also outlives the deploy whose JS bundles it references. The browser's own offline page is a better failure than a stale, wrong-session one. Only `/_next/static/`, `/icons/`, `/images/` and `/manifest.json` are cached; bump `CACHE_NAME` whenever the caching rules change, since the activate handler evicts by name.

## Timezone Handling

All times are IST (Asia/Kolkata). The `TZ` env var is set in npm scripts and in `src/lib/prisma.ts` (`process.env.TZ = 'Asia/Kolkata'`). PostgreSQL timezone is configured via connection string options parameter. Time slab determination uses `toLocaleTimeString('en-IN', { timeZone: 'Asia/Kolkata' })`.

## Testing

Tests use Vitest with jsdom environment. Path alias `@` maps to `./src`. Setup file at `src/__tests__/setup.ts`. Test files match `src/**/*.{test,spec}.{ts,tsx}`. Coverage targets `src/lib/**` and `src/components/**`.

## Key Environment Variables

`DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`, `FAST2SMS_API_KEY`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, `SUPER_ADMIN_MOBILE` (super-admin bootstrap — the phone-keyed one that actually works), `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `INITIAL_ADMIN_MOBILE`, `OTP_MAX_ATTEMPTS`, `OTP_GLOBAL_PER_MINUTE`, `GOOGLE_LOGIN_ENABLED` (off). See `.env.example` for full list.

`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` are now treated as the **fallback** for any center that hasn't configured its own keys. Each `Center` row may store `razorpayKeyId` / `razorpayKeySecret` / `razorpayWebhookSecret`; the payment helper picks center-specific keys when present (phase 6 — pending).

## Multi-Center Architecture

### Concepts
- **Center** (`prisma.center`): an independent operational unit. ABCA seeded as `ctr_abca` (slug `abca`). New centers added via super admin UI. Each has its own location, contacts, Razorpay keys, machines, admins, pricing, and policies.
- **CenterMembership** (`prisma.centerMembership`): links a User to a Center with a role (`ADMIN`, `OPERATOR`, `COACH`, `SIDEARM_STAFF`). Multiple memberships per user supported.
- **Resource** (`prisma.resource`): a physical bookable unit at a center — `NET`, `TURF_WICKET`, `CEMENT_WICKET`, `COURT`. Used by the resource-based booking model (Toplay).
- **MachineType** (`prisma.machineType`): catalog of machine designs (Yantra/Leverage/Gravity/…). Adding a new model is data-only.
- **Machine** (`prisma.machine`): a specific machine instance at a center. ABCA's four legacy machines are seeded with `legacyMachineId` set, bridging the existing `MachineId` enum to the new table.
- **Booking model** (`Center.bookingModel`): `MACHINE_PITCH` (ABCA — legacy enum-based) or `RESOURCE_BASED` (Toplay — consumes Resources). New centers default to `MACHINE_PITCH`; switch to `RESOURCE_BASED` in the center config when needed.

### Center resolution (current center for a request)
Order (first match wins): `?center=<slug>` query → `selectedCenterId` cookie → user's first membership → first active center. Implemented in `src/lib/centers.ts → resolveCurrentCenter()`. **No subdomain, no path prefix** — keeps URLs stable for TWA/PWA installs and existing bookmarks.

### Super admin
The `User.isSuperAdmin` boolean column is the source of truth. Super admins bypass center scoping (`canAccessCenter` returns true for any centerId).

**Granting it is three separate things**, and you usually need more than one:

| Grant | Unlocks |
|---|---|
| `User.role = 'ADMIN'` | past the middleware into `/admin` |
| `User.isSuperAdmin = true` | cross-center pages (Centers, Orphan Payments, Maintenance, DB Cleanup) and a bypass of every center scope check |
| `CenterMembership(role='ADMIN')` | center-scoped **writes** — without it you can open Configuration but `POST /api/admin/policies` 403s on Save |

`npx tsx scripts/make-admin.ts <email|mobile> [--super] [--center <slug>]` does all three. **No admin UI writes `isSuperAdmin`** — `PATCH /api/admin/users` accepts `role` but not that column, by design. Note a super admin needs no `CenterMembership`: `canAccessCenter` / `hasMembershipRole` return true for any center, so the third row only matters for a plain center admin.

**Bootstrapping the first super admin: `SUPER_ADMIN_MOBILE`.** Set it to the number, redeploy, sign in — `/api/auth/otp/verify` promotes that account to `role=ADMIN` + `isSuperAdmin=true` on login. It is the phone-keyed twin of what `authOptions.signIn` already does for `SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` on the Google path, and follows the same rule: **upgrade only, never a demotion** (the fields are omitted from the update entirely when the number doesn't match, so clearing the env var later doesn't take the rights away). `role` moves along with the flag because the middleware gates `/admin` on the role in the JWT — `isSuperAdmin` with `role=USER` would still be bounced at the door. `auth.ts` also matches it as a read-side fallback in `toAuthenticatedUser`, so an already-open session picks up super-admin on its next request without re-login.

> **`SUPER_ADMIN_EMAIL` does not work for a WhatsApp account.** It is matched against `dbUser.email` in `auth.ts`, and `scripts/seed-centers.ts` looks the user up by email too — but accounts are keyed on `mobileNumber` and typically have **no email at all**, so both silently no-op. Use `SUPER_ADMIN_MOBILE` (needs only a Vercel env var + a login) or `make-admin.ts` (needs DB access, but grants center memberships too).

`requireSuperAdmin(req)` from `src/lib/adminAuth.ts` is the API-route guard for cross-center operations (managing centers, the machine-type catalog, etc.). Use `requireAdmin(req)` for center-scoped admin actions and combine with `hasMembershipRole(user, centerId, 'ADMIN')` to enforce the user is admin at *this* center.

### Center management UI (`/admin/centers/*`)
- `/admin/centers` — list, create new center
- `/admin/centers/[id]` — edit, with tabs: General · Payment · Machines · Resources · Members · Policies
- Tab components live under `src/components/admin/centers/` so the page file stays focused on routing
- Only visible to super admins (link in admin sidebar gated on `session.user.isSuperAdmin`)
- API routes: `/api/admin/centers`, `/api/admin/centers/[id]`, `/api/admin/centers/[id]/{machines,resources,members,policies}`, `/api/admin/machine-types`

### Center switcher (admin sidebar)
`src/components/admin/CenterSwitcher.tsx` shows the active center and lets admins/super-admins switch via `POST /api/centers/select`, which sets the `selectedCenterId` cookie and reloads. Hidden when the user has only one center option.

### User-side center experience (phase 4)
- `CenterProvider` in `src/lib/center-context.tsx` is mounted via `Providers.tsx`. Any user-app component can call `useCenter()` to read `{ centers, currentCenter, switchTo, refresh }`.
- `src/components/CenterSelector.tsx` — compact pill in the user `Navbar` (auto-hides for single-center installs). Lets users switch centers and links to `/centers`.
- `src/app/centers/page.tsx` — public listing of all active centers. Shows address/phone/email; "Use my location" button computes Haversine distance and sorts ascending. Tapping a center calls `switchTo(id)`, which sets the cookie and reloads to the URL passed in `?next=` (defaults to `/slots`).
- `ContactFooter` reads from the current center's `contactPhone`, `contactEmail`, `mapUrl`. Falls back to the platform-wide `CONTACT_NUMBERS`/`LOCATION_URL` constants when those fields are blank.
- `LandingPageClient` renders a "N locations available" pill that links to `/centers` only when multiple centers exist.
- `/centers` and `/api/centers/*` are publicly accessible (added to middleware allowlist).

### When adding new code
- Every API route that reads/writes center-scoped data must scope by `centerId`. Use `resolveCurrentCenter(req, user)` and check `canAccessCenter(user, center.id)`.
- New domain tables: add `centerId` + FK to `Center` + `(centerId, ...)` composite index/unique. Backfill in the same migration.
- New config keys: read via `getPolicyValue(key, centerId, fallback)` to inherit center→global→default.
- Razorpay calls: use the center's keys (phase 6 — `getRazorpayInstance(center)` will replace the env-based singleton).

### `?allCenters=true` convention
Admin/operator GET routes that return aggregate or list data accept an optional `allCenters=true` query param. When set, the route ignores the current center and returns data across every center — gated to super admins only. The default (no param) always scopes to the resolved current center. Use this for the platform-wide super-admin dashboard; never for plain admin views.

**Exception — `/api/admin/users`:** the admin Users listing lets *any* admin pass `allCenters=true` (the `All users` / `This center` toggle on `/admin/users`). User lookup is intentionally cross-center so a center admin can find someone who hasn't booked at their center yet. This only widens *read* visibility — mutating actions on that route stay individually gated (delete and free-user toggles remain super-admin only).

### Resource-based booking engine (phase 5)

Centers with `bookingModel = RESOURCE_BASED` (e.g. Toplay) use a different booking primitive than ABCA. Instead of `(machineId, pitchType)` lanes, every booking consumes one or more `Resource` rows (nets/courts/turf wickets) plus optionally a `Machine`, a coach (User with COACH membership), or a sidearm-staff member (SIDEARM_STAFF membership).

**Booking categories** (`Booking.category`, `BookingCategory` enum):
- `MACHINE` — bowling machine session: 1 net + 1 Machine instance.
- `SIDEARM` — sidearm-staff session: 1 net + 1 SIDEARM_STAFF user.
- `COACHING` — personal coaching: 1 net + 1 COACH user.
- `FULL_COURT` — full indoor court: every active indoor net.
- `CORPORATE_BATCH` — seat-based Match Practice enrollment (see "Match Practice" below).
- `MATCH_SIMULATION` — seat-based Match Practice group session (see below).

ABCA's existing rows default to `MACHINE` and have no `BookingResourceAssignment` rows; nothing changes for them.

**Category labels** live in one place — `src/lib/booking-categories.ts` (`BOOKING_CATEGORY_LABELS` / `bookingCategoryLabel`), which every admin surface that names a category reads: the bookings CSV, the packages CSV (via `packageCategoryLabel`), and the Assign Package picker. The label is **always the base category**: a Corporate Batch or Match Simulation row exports as `Corporate Batch` / `Match Simulation` with no `(Monthly)` / `(Regular)` purchase-mode suffix, so a sheet can be grouped or pivoted on the column directly. The mode/period still lives on `Booking.corporateBatchMode` / `enrollmentPeriod` and is rendered as its own "Enrollment" row on the booking card — it just never rides along inside the category string. `expandBookableCategories()` turns a center's `ENABLED_BOOKING_CATEGORIES` list into real enum values, expanding the `MATCH_PRACTICE` umbrella into `CORPORATE_BATCH` + `MATCH_SIMULATION`; the admin Bookings category filter and Packages → Assign both drive their dropdowns from it, so enabling/disabling a category in Admin → Settings flows through with no code change.

**Key files**:
- `src/lib/resource-booking.ts` — availability lookup (`getSlotAvailability`, `computeSlotAvailability`), booking-plan resolution (`planBooking`, `BookingResourceError`), and atomic resource-assignment persistence (`persistResourceAssignments`). The corporate-batch indoor-net hold is a virtual reservation overlay driven by the `CORPORATE_BATCH_CONFIG` policy.
- `src/lib/resource-pricing.ts` — per-category pricing (`RESOURCE_PRICING_CONFIG` policy) with optional Yantra/Leverage overrides via `MachineType.code`.
- `/api/slots/resource-availability` — slot grid for RESOURCE_BASED centers (returns free nets, coaches, staff, full-court status, and per-category prices).
- `/api/slots/book-resource` — booking creation for RESOURCE_BASED centers; serializable transaction with retry on serialization conflicts.

**Default `CORPORATE_BATCH_CONFIG`**: Mon/Wed/Fri, 07:00–09:00 IST, 2 indoor nets held, disabled until the admin turns it on. Override via `CenterPolicy('CORPORATE_BATCH_CONFIG')` — the same key also carries the Match Practice enrollment knobs (coach, fees, capacity, half-month; see below).

**User UI**: `/slots` page now routes via `SlotsRouter` based on `currentCenter.bookingModel`:
- `MACHINE_PITCH` → existing `SlotsContent` (legacy ABCA flow, untouched).
- `RESOURCE_BASED` → `src/app/slots/ResourceSlotsPage.tsx` — date picker, category tabs (Machine / Sidearm / Coaching / Full Court / Match Practice), per-category secondary picker (machine / coach / staff), slot grid with per-slot bookability + price, multi-slot selection, sticky booking bar, confirm dialog, submits to `/api/slots/book-resource`.

### Operator availability & capacity

Operators are staffed exactly like Ground Staff / Coaches / Sidearm Specialists — there is no operator-specific configuration model any more. Each `CenterMembership(role='OPERATOR')` carries weekly `MembershipAvailability` windows (with an optional effective date range) plus a `priority` (1 = first pick), both edited on **Admin → Operators** (`src/app/admin/operators/page.tsx`), which is a 1:1 mirror of Admin → Ground Staff and reuses `SpecialistAvailabilityCard` / the `…/members/[membershipId]/availability` endpoint.

Rules, all in `src/lib/operatorAssign.ts`:
- **On duty** = the operator's weekly schedule covers the slot. **No schedule configured = NOT available** — an operator is only eligible for auto-assignment once an admin has entered a window that covers the slot. This is the coach / sidearm rule (`slotMatchesMembershipAvailability` returns false on an empty schedule), **not** the ground-staff rule; `pickGroundStaffForSlot` keeps its "unscheduled = always on the floor" fallback because ground staff are a floor contact rather than an assignable resource. Consequence when rolling out to a center that hasn't filled schedules in yet: capacity is 0, so LEATHER is unbookable and TENNIS self-operates until the schedules exist. Admin → Operators warns about unscheduled operators by count.
- **One operator, one booking.** The number of operator-assisted MACHINE bookings a slot can hold equals the number of operators available for that slot — never the roster size. `getOperatorSlotCapacity` returns `{ onDuty, busy, free, freeOperatorIds }`; `autoAssignOperator` takes the highest-priority free one, or null when the slot is at capacity.
- `onDuty === 0` → nobody available: LEATHER machines are unbookable, TENNIS falls back to `SELF_OPERATE`. Same fallback when `free === 0`. Enforced server-side in `/api/slots/book-resource` (409 for LEATHER) and surfaced to the grid by `/api/slots/resource-availability` as `operatorCount` / `operatorsBusy` / `operatorAvailable` / `selfOperate`.
- The **manual** operator reassignment on Admin → Bookings (`canOperateAtCenter`) is deliberately *not* availability-gated — it is an admin override for the off-schedule case.
- Changing an operator's availability does **not** cancel or refund existing bookings (`bookingAssignmentFilter` returns null for OPERATOR, as for GROUND_STAFF) — operators are fungible and never user-picked, so an admin reassigns from Admin → Bookings instead.

**Removed, do not reintroduce**: the `OPERATOR_SCHEDULE_CONFIG` and `OPERATOR_DATE_OVERRIDES` policies, the `NUMBER_OF_OPERATORS` fallback for staffing, the day+slab priority matrix on `User.operator*Priority`, and the per-machine `OperatorAssignment` table. The columns/table survive in the schema marked DEPRECATED so existing rows aren't destroyed, but nothing reads them. `/api/admin/operators` is now GET-only (the Admin → Bookings reassignment dropdown); `/api/admin/override-cancellations` is gone.

### Staff Mode booking visibility (`/staff`)

One page, one tab per `CenterMembership` role the user holds (admins see all four). Each tab is that role's **operational category**, not a personal worklist — `/api/staff/bookings?role=…`:

| Tab | Shows | Scoped by assignee? |
|---|---|---|
| Operator | `category = MACHINE` — every bowling-machine session at the center | ❌ no |
| Ground Staff | every facility category: `NET`, `FULL_COURT`, `MATCH_SIMULATION`, `CORPORATE_BATCH` | ❌ no |
| Sidearm | `category = SIDEARM` | ✅ `assignedStaffId = viewer` |
| Coach | `category = COACHING` | ✅ `assignedCoachId = viewer` |

Operator and Ground Staff are deliberately **assignment-blind**: any operator sees every machine booking whoever it's assigned to, and any ground-staff member sees every facility booking, so the floor can be coordinated by whoever is on it. Sidearm specialists and coaches stay scoped to their own sessions (those are personally-booked resources). Admins keep full visibility on every tab.

The Ground Staff category set is expressed as the **complement** of `GROUND_STAFF_EXCLUDED_CATEGORIES` (`MACHINE`, `SIDEARM`, `COACHING`) rather than an allowlist, so a new facility category shows up without a code change — and it lines up with the booking engine, where exactly those three categories leave `assignedGroundStaffId` null.

### Match Practice (Corporate Batch + Match Simulation)

Seat-based booking category for RESOURCE_BASED centers — no machine, ball type, pitch type, or operator anywhere in the flow. The user-facing "Match Practice" tab (`MATCH_PRACTICE` in `ENABLED_BOOKING_CATEGORIES`, a UI umbrella, NOT a `BookingCategory` value) renders `src/app/slots/MatchPracticePanel.tsx` with two subcategories:

- **Corporate Batch** (`Booking.category = CORPORATE_BATCH`): fixed weekly batch (default Mon/Wed/Fri 07:00–09:00, coach Govind Lashkare, capacity 25). Two purchase modes on `Booking.corporateBatchMode`: `MONTHLY` (₹2000 default; one row per user per month, `enrollmentPeriod = "YYYY-MM"`; optional `HALF_MONTH` split — "YYYY-MM-H1"/"-H2" — when enabled in config) and `REGULAR` (₹200/session default; one row per attended date; renamed from `ADHOC` — config key `regularFee`, legacy `adhocFee` still read). Session seats = members whose period covers the date + regular (per-session) rows for that date. Config: `CORPORATE_BATCH_CONFIG` (shared with the net-hold overlay).
- **Match Simulation** (`Booking.category = MATCH_SIMULATION`): admin-CRUD session list in `MATCH_SIMULATION_CONFIG` — each session has days (default Tue/Thu/Fri/Sat/Sun), a time window (default 07:00–09:00), capacity (default 10), fee, optional coach, and an enabled flag; multiple sessions per day supported. Seats counted per `(date, startTime)`.

**Session Type box**: shown whenever **at least one** subcategory is enabled, listing only the enabled ones — with a single type it stays as one selected tile so the user can still see what they're booking. It is hidden only when *both* are disabled, and that case already short-circuits to the "not available at this center" state before the box renders. Do not gate it on "both enabled" again; a center that runs only Match Simulation still needs the label.

**Landing defaults**: tapping Match Practice arrives on **Match Simulation** + **Regular** (per-day session) for both subcategories, so the user only has to pick a session. Match Simulation is the fallback-second choice only when it is the disabled one. Both stay freely switchable.

**Key files**: `src/lib/match-practice.ts` (config normalization, session/occurrence generation, `resolveMatchPracticePlans`, in-tx `assertMatchPracticeSeat` capacity + duplicate guards), `/api/match-practice/availability` (months with enrollment counts + upcoming sessions with seat counts), `/api/slots/book-resource` (dispatches both categories through the same payment/wallet/refund machinery; capacity re-checked inside the serializable tx), `src/components/admin/MatchPracticeConfigEditor.tsx` (Admin → Settings → Match Practice card). Fees are flat admin-set amounts — recurring/promotional discounts and packages don't apply; admin blocks (`BlockedSlot.categories`) do.

### Booking notifications by role (`BOOKING_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG`)

Who, beyond the customer, hears about a booking. Two disjoint kinds of recipient, both delivered by the same pair of helpers in `src/lib/notifications.ts` (`notifyAssignedStaffNewBooking` / `notifyAssignedStaffBookingCancelled`):

- **Assigned** (`StaffRecipient.kind = 'ASSIGNED'`) — the people pinned to *that* booking: its operator / coach / sidearm specialist / ground staff. Unchanged, always on, worded "assigned to you".
- **Subscribed** (`kind = 'SUBSCRIBED'`) — everyone holding a `CenterMembership` role the center has switched on. They get the same alert for **every** booking at the center, worded "at your center" (nothing is assigned to them). This is how a moderator running the floor sees every booking.

Config is the per-center `BOOKING_NOTIFICATION_CONFIG` policy, resolved center → global → code default by `getPolicyJson` and coerced by `normalizeBookingNotificationConfig` (`src/lib/booking-notifications.ts` — a **pure module with no Prisma import**, so the admin editor and the server share one normalizer):

```json
{
  "roles": { "ADMIN": false, "MODERATOR": true, "OPERATOR": false,
             "COACH": false, "SIDEARM_SPECIALIST": false, "GROUND_STAFF": false },
  "events": { "created": true, "cancelled": true },
  "whatsapp": true
}
```

**`MODERATOR` is the only role on by default** — moderators get every booking with zero configuration, and turning the feature up can never silently start messaging a center's whole roster. Every `MembershipRole` is configurable; `MEMBERSHIP_ROLE_LABELS` is typed `Record<MembershipRole, string>` so adding a role to the enum is a compile error until it's labelled (a parity test asserts it too). The normalizer is tolerant by design (the row is hand-editable on `/admin/policies`): per-field fallback, string booleans accepted, unknown keys dropped, and a bare `["MODERATOR","ADMIN"]` array read as "these on, all others off".

**Dedup, in `withRoleSubscribers`**: the exclude set is seeded from the already-collected assigned recipients, every booking row's `userId`, and — on cancellations — the `actorUserId` of whoever performed it. So an assigned coach who also holds a `COACH` membership is paged once (keeping the richer "assigned" copy), a user holding two enabled roles is paged once under the earlier canonical role, a moderator who books their own slot gets only the customer confirmation, and an admin who blocks a morning isn't sent one message per cancelled booking narrating their own click. `cancelledBy` can't serve as the actor — it's a display name, not an id — so all four cancel call sites pass `actorUserId` explicitly.

**Delivery**: in-app is always created and now carries `bookingId`, so a subscriber's alert renders the full Bookings-page card, not a pipe-separated summary. WhatsApp goes through an **approved template** (`WHATSAPP_STAFF_BOOKING_TEMPLATE` / `_CANCEL_TEMPLATE` when set, else the approved customer `booking_detail` / `booking_cancelled`) — free-form text only delivers inside the 24h service window and a subscriber has almost certainly never messaged the business. `config.whatsapp: false` keeps subscribers in-app only *without* muting assigned staff; it exists because the BSP bills per template message, so a center with five admins pays 5× per booking.

**Never throws**: `loadRoleSubscribers` catches everything and returns `[]`, so a policy or membership failure can't strand the assigned-staff alerts, which are the load-bearing ones.

**Volume**: creation batches a multi-slot submission into **one** message per recipient; cancellation is per booking row, so an admin block that cancels N bookings sends N alerts per recipient (pre-existing for assigned staff, amplified across a role by subscribers). Batch it there if it becomes a problem.

**Edited on Admin → Configuration → "Booking Notifications"** (`src/components/admin/BookingNotificationsEditor.tsx`, saved by the page's single Save button via `POST /api/admin/policies`). That page is **admin-only** — moderators *receive* these notifications but cannot configure them, and `/admin/configuration` stays in the middleware moderator blocklist.

**Reading them**: `/notifications` is the inbox, linked from the admin sidebar and admin bottom nav ("Alerts") so a recipient doesn't have to leave the panel. That page's auth gate is driven by the API response, **not** `useSession()` — PlayOrbit has two login paths and gating on the NextAuth session alone locked every mobile-OTP user (i.e. most staff) out of their own alerts. Signed-out has two shapes there: the route's 401, and the middleware's redirect of `/api/*` to the landing page, which arrives as a followed 307 (status 200, HTML body) — both are treated as signed out, a thrown fetch is not.

An alert about **someone else's** booking is a staff / role-subscriber one, and `GET /api/notifications` flags it with `isOwnBooking: false`. The view then renders the card **and** keeps the message text underneath. The card alone is not enough for staff: it is a snapshot of the *first* row (so a 4-slot booking would show one half-hour window and one slot's price instead of the batch span and total), and `mapBookingForCard` emits no customer contact at all, so the booker's phone — which the message carries and floor staff act on — appears nowhere on it. Switching the card to `role="operator"` does **not** fix that (the field isn't in the payload) and would drop the refund block, so the role stays `user` and the message supplies the rest.

The card is also **re-authorised on every fetch**, because it is re-read live rather than frozen like the message: someone else's booking only renders a card while the viewer still holds a `CenterMembership` at that booking's center (`canAccessCenter`). Without that, a revoked operator's months-old alerts would keep streaming those bookings' current status, price and refunds. Dropping the card leaves the historical message text — exactly what staff alerts showed before they carried a `bookingId`.

### Ledger (manual revenue & expenses)

Admin → **Ledger** (`/admin/ledger`) records money the booking engine never sees. Two tabs over one `LedgerEntry` table, discriminated by `kind`:

- **Manual Revenue** (`kind = REVENUE`) — walk-in cash, off-platform transfers. Fields: `revenueCategory`, `customerName`.
- **Expenses** (`kind = EXPENSE`) — `expenseCategory` (`REPAIRS_MAINTENANCE`, `BALLS`, `STAFF_PAYMENTS`, `UTILITIES_CONSUMABLES`, `MISCELLANEOUS`), `expenseSubcategory` (TEXT code validated against the catalog in `src/lib/ledger.ts`, so it grows without a migration), `description`, `paidTo`.

`LedgerRevenueCategory` mirrors `BookingCategory` **one-for-one** — `MACHINE`, `NET`, `SIDEARM`, `COACHING`, `FULL_COURT`, `CORPORATE_BATCH`, `MATCH_SIMULATION` — plus `OTHER` for income with no service behind it. Corporate Batch and Match Simulation are listed individually, *not* as the `MATCH_PRACTICE` UI umbrella (which isn't a `BookingCategory` and has no dashboard bucket). A test in `ledger.test.ts` asserts this parity, so adding a booking category fails loudly until the ledger follows.

Shared columns (both kinds): `amount`, `entryDate`/`entryTime` (when the money actually moved), `paymentMethod` (`LedgerPaymentMethod`: `CASH` / `ONLINE` / `OTHER`), `remarks`, `collectedById`, `recordedById`.

**Session timing is REVENUE-only**: `serviceDate`/`serviceStartTime`/`serviceEndTime` (the session this revenue was earned from, as an optional From/To range, separate from when the money moved). Expenses have no session behind them — the expense form omits the block, the expense Zod schema doesn't accept the fields, `toLedgerColumns` nulls them, and the expense CSV has no session columns. The columns stay on the shared table.

**List + detail**: the list shows only Date · Category · Amount · Payment Method · Collected By ("Expense Made By" for expenses) so it fits a phone with no horizontal scrolling; tapping a row opens `LedgerDetailDialog` with everything else (customer/description, vendor, session, remarks, recorded by) plus Edit/Delete. Deletion confirms through the app-wide `ConfirmDialog` (`variant="danger"`), not `window.confirm`.

**Filters**: date range · category · payment method · who handled the money · recorded by · free-text search, all combinable and all shared with the CSV export through `buildLedgerWhere`. The money-handler filter is one column (`collectedById`) wearing two labels — **Collected By** on Manual Revenue, **Expenses Made By** on Expenses — matching the list header, which already renames itself per kind. Its options come from the GET response's `handlers` (everyone who *appears* as `collectedBy` on an entry here), not from `collectors` (active members, the entry form's picker): a staff member who leaves must stay filterable or their history becomes unreachable. Same rule as `recorders`.

- **`collectedById`** — who physically handled the money; a `User` FK (nullable), *not* an enum of staff names, so the picker tracks the center's live roster. The API rejects any user without an active `CenterMembership` at the center. Defaults in the form to whoever is adding the entry.
- **`recordedById`** — who keyed it in. **Always stamped from the session server-side, never accepted from the request body**, and never rewritten on edit (the moderator edit check keys off it, so rewriting would let an edit hand ownership away).

**Naming**: this was specced as "Ad Hoc Revenue / Ad Hoc Expenses". "Ad hoc" already means the per-session Match Practice purchase mode (`CorporateBatchMode.REGULAR`, formerly `ADHOC`) and both would appear on the same dashboard, so the module is the **Ledger** and its sides are "Manual Revenue" and "Expenses". Nothing user-visible says "ad hoc".

**Key files**: `src/lib/ledger.ts` (labels, subcategory catalog, discriminated-union Zod schema, `toLedgerColumns` — which nulls the other kind's columns so switching kind on edit can't leave stale data), `src/components/admin/ledger/LedgerDetailDialog.tsx`, `src/lib/ledger-query.ts` (`buildLedgerWhere`, shared by list + CSV so an export always matches the screen), `/api/admin/ledger` (GET list + totals, POST), `/api/admin/ledger/[id]` (PATCH, DELETE), `/api/admin/ledger/export` (CSV), `src/app/admin/ledger/page.tsx`, `src/components/admin/ledger/`.

**Permissions** (`requireCenterAdmin`, which admits both roles and reports `isModerator`):

| | View all | Create | Edit own | Edit others' | Delete |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Center ADMIN | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| MODERATOR | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 |

The GET response carries `canDelete`, `canEditAll` and `viewerId` so the UI can gate per row; every rule is re-enforced in `[id]/route.ts`. `/admin/ledger` is intentionally absent from the middleware moderator blocklist.

**Dashboard**: `/api/admin/stats` adds `manualRevenue` and `manualExpenses` (grouped by `kind` + `revenueCategory`, scoped by `entryDate` against the dashboard range). **Total Revenue = booking + package + manual revenue**; expenses are a separate card and are never netted off revenue. See "Admin dashboard revenue" below for how manual revenue folds into the charts.

### Admin dashboard revenue (`/admin` + `/api/admin/stats`)

Every rupee comes from **one formula**, applied to bookings, package purchases and Ledger entries alike:

```
Revenue = Σ(online) + Σ(wallet) − Σ(refunds)
```

`src/lib/dashboard-revenue.ts` is the single fold. The route turns each money source into a `RevenueRow` (`{ category, online, wallet, refunds, machineName }`) and `aggregateRevenue` buckets them, so two rules hold **by construction** — not by coincidence — and are asserted in `dashboard-revenue.test.ts`:

1. **Σ(Revenue-by-Category bars) === Total Revenue** (=== Bookings + Packages + Manual).
2. **Σ(Revenue-by-Machine bars) === the Bowling Machine category bar.**

Consequences worth knowing:

- **Manual revenue merges into the same category bars as system revenue** — a hand-recorded sidearm session sits on the Sidearm bar next to the booked ones. The only extra category bar is `OTHER` (manual income with no service behind it). It reaches the **machine** chart too, under a `Manual Entry` bar (`MANUAL_MACHINE_LABEL`), because a manual entry names a category but never a machine and rule 2 has to hold. A machine booking that names no machine lands on `Other` (`UNATTRIBUTED_MACHINE_LABEL`).
- **CANCELLED bookings and packages are included, net of their refunds.** A cancellation that retained a fee retained money; excluding the row reported that fee as ₹0. A fully refunded one nets to zero on its own.
- **Refunds are subtracted unclamped** (`splitAmountNetSigned`, not `splitAmountNet`). A refund is sized from the slot's mutable `price` and can exceed that slot's even share of its order, so zeroing a negative row before summing would strand the excess and over-report the order. The clamped `splitAmountNet` stays the **one-row display** figure (admin bookings list, CSV).
- **Cash collects nothing through these rails and contributes 0** — walk-in cash belongs in the Ledger as Manual Revenue.
- **Profit = Total Revenue − Expenses**, derived on the client from the two cards beside it so the three can never disagree on screen.

**Operator Sessions card**: all four numbers count the same universe — non-cancelled `category = MACHINE` bookings in range — partitioned into three disjoint, exhaustive buckets so `Total = Σ(per-operator) + Self-Operate + Unassigned` always holds: `operatorId` set / no operator + `SELF_OPERATE` / no operator + `WITH_OPERATOR`. The `category: MACHINE` scope is what makes the identity true: `operationMode` is a non-null column defaulting to `WITH_OPERATOR` and the resource engine stamps every non-machine row `SELF_OPERATE`, so counting across all categories dumped every net / sidearm / coaching / match-practice booking into the Self-Operate and Unassigned buckets.

### Cricket Store — bats, gloves, thigh guards & gear

The in-app store. Customers see **Cricket Store** (nav label "Store") at **`/shop`** (public — browsable signed-out, like `/centers`); the back office is **Admin → Cricket Store** at **`/admin/shop`**. **It is one catalog for all of PlayOrbit, not a center's**: `MarketplaceProduct` has no `centerId`, every visitor sees the same products whichever center they book at, and hand-pick/collection happens at one configured location (initially Toplay — the `pickupNote` below). The "advanced version" turns the pickup note into structured pickup options; nothing about the catalog is per center.

**Who runs it — store admins.** `User.isStoreAdmin` is a platform-level grant modelled on `isSuperAdmin`, **never a center membership**. `canManageStore(user)` (`src/lib/auth.ts`) = store admin or super admin; center admins and moderators are excluded as such, whichever center they run. Granted only by a super admin: the **Make Store Admin** button on a user's card in Admin → Users (`PATCH /api/admin/users { isStoreAdmin }`, super-admin only, like the free-booking toggle) or `npx tsx scripts/make-admin.ts <mobile> --store` (which does **not** touch `User.role`, so a store admin who is otherwise a customer stays a USER). Onboarding: the person signs in once with WhatsApp (that creates the account), a super admin flips the toggle, they sign in again — the grant rides in the session token (`isStoreAdmin` / `isSuperAdmin` claims, set at `/api/auth/otp/verify`).

Enforcement is three layers, and the API is the one that counts:
- **Middleware**: a signed-in user without an admin role but with the `isStoreAdmin` claim gets exactly `/admin/shop` (every other `/admin/*` bounces there — the specialist self-service pattern). A role holder whose token says `isStoreAdmin: false` and `isSuperAdmin: false` is turned away from `/admin/shop`; a token issued before those claims existed carries neither and is left to the API. `/admin/shop` also stays in the moderator blocklist.
- **API**: every `/api/admin/shop/*` route goes through `requireShopAdmin` (`src/app/api/admin/shop/shared.ts`) = `getAuthenticatedUser` + `canManageStore`. It deliberately does **not** use `requireCenterAdmin` and resolves no center.
- **UI**: the admin sidebar / mobile nav show the Cricket Store link on `canManageStore`; `useAdminRole()` exposes `isStoreAdmin` and `canManageStore`; the Navbar's Admin button also appears for store-only admins and sends them straight to `/admin/shop`.

**Launch state is the global `MARKETPLACE_CONFIG` policy** — the `Policy` table, never `CenterPolicy` — normalised by `normalizeMarketplaceConfig` in `src/lib/marketplace.ts` (a **pure module** shared by the admin editor and the routes) and read by `getMarketplaceConfig()` (no arguments):

```json
{ "enabled": true, "comingSoon": true, "launchNote": "", "pickupNote": "Hand-pick and collect your gear at Toplay.", "enquiryPhone": "" }
```

- `comingSoon: true` (the default) is the pre-launch mode the store ships in: every card wears an amber **Coming soon** ribbon, the product page offers **Notify me when available** (a `MarketplaceInterest` row) plus **Ask on WhatsApp**. There is no cart or checkout.
- `comingSoon: false` opens ordering **over WhatsApp**: **Order on WhatsApp** deep-links `wa.me` with a prefilled message (product, size, quantity, the user's default delivery address, product URL — `buildEnquiryMessage`). Online checkout/Razorpay for the store is deliberately not built yet.
- `enabled: false` hides the store everywhere (nav entries, landing section, promo strip; `/shop` renders "closed").
- `pickupNote` is shown under the store heading, on the empty-catalog teaser and on every product page. A stored empty string hides it; only a missing key falls back to the default.
- `enquiryPhone` is the store's own WhatsApp number. Blank hides the WhatsApp buttons — there is **no fallback to a center's phone** (`resolveEnquiryPhone(config)`). Edited on Admin → Cricket Store → Store settings (`PUT /api/admin/shop/settings`).

**"Notify me" is a lead list, not an automated message.** The interest rows surface on Admin → Cricket Store as a count per product and a list of names and numbers; nothing messages them when `comingSoon` flips or stock arrives — the store admin follows up over WhatsApp from that list. Build the automation before promising it in copy.

**Where it is highlighted**: Navbar desktop link + BottomNav tab "Store" (a "Pre-book" pill on desktop, an amber dot on the phone tab, while `comingSoon` — never "Soon", which tells a visitor to come back later on a page asking them to act), the landing page's store section (`LandingShopSection` — the `KisSpotlight` campaign for the one bat, with the live price off the catalog row via `GET /api/shop/status`) plus the `KisMarquee` ribbon under the hero (label carries the live price too) and a "Store" pill in the landing nav, and the **permanent** `MarketplacePromoBanner` card at the top of `/slots` — the whole card is a link to the bat, with thumbnail, live price and the pre-book / now-open pill. It is deliberately **not dismissible**: the old strip stored its dismissal in localStorage for good, so a player who closed it on day one never saw the store from there again. It renders while the status loads (static copy, no price) so it never pops in and shoves the booking form down. All of them read one cached client fetch of `/api/shop/status` through `useMarketplaceStatus()` (`src/lib/marketplace-status.tsx`); the admin settings card calls `invalidateMarketplaceStatus()` after a save, which refetches and pushes the new status to every mounted consumer. The status route is `no-store` so that save reads back fresh. The PWA manifest also carries a **Cricket Store** shortcut (long-press the app icon); `manifest.json` is cache-first in `sw.js`, so bump `CACHE_NAME` when it changes.

**The one-bat launch surfaces** (all keyed on `isKisModel(row)` in `src/lib/kis-showcase.ts`, so a product that is *not* the M&H 7000 never borrows its photography or copy): `KisSpotlight` (hero-scale plate, CTA reads **PRE-BOOK NOW** / **ORDER NOW** / SEE THE BAT when sold out or unloaded), `KisHighlights` (the four claims with a line each — `KIS_HIGHLIGHTS`), `KisHowItWorks` (three steps, pre-booking wording vs ordering wording — `KIS_STEPS`), `KisMarquee` (the shoot), and `StoreSocialLinks` (WhatsApp question + the PlayOrbit Instagram). When the M&H 7000 is the **whole published catalog** (`soloKis` in `ShopPageClient`), `/shop` drops the lone product card under the spotlight — it was the same link again, shaped like a store with three products missing — and shows highlights + how-it-works instead; a second published product brings the grid straight back. The product page shows the compact highlights under the pickup note and how-it-works before the shoot, for that bat only.

**Share cards** (`src/lib/marketplace-seo.ts`, pure): the store is marketed over WhatsApp, and every store link used to preview as the generic "book cricket practice" cover. `/shop` exports `storeMetadata()`; `/shop/[id]` has a `generateMetadata` that reads the row straight from Prisma (a fetch back to our own origin would hit the middleware) and returns `productMetadata()` — **live price in the title**, the pre-book / order state and the description's first paragraph in the description, and the image. The image is the static **`/images/og-store.jpg`** (1200×630, kept under WhatsApp's ~300 KB preview ceiling, rendered by `scripts/kis-creatives/render-og-card.py` from the snow shot; re-run after `npm ci`, which supplies the Geist TTFs). It carries no price and no launch state on purpose — WhatsApp caches previews for days, so anything the admin can change rides in the text. The M&H 7000 always gets the store card; another product uses its own primary photo and falls back to the card. An unknown, unpublished or store-off product, or a failed read, gets the store card rather than a 500. `ShareButton` (`src/components/shop/ShareButton.tsx`) opens the phone's share sheet (`navigator.share`, WhatsApp one tap away) and copies the link elsewhere; its text comes from `buildShareText` (product, live price, state — no URL, the sheet takes that separately).

**Schema** (`prisma/schema.prisma`; migrations `20260905120000_marketplace_and_addresses` then `20260906120000_store_platform_wide`, which dropped `centerId` and added `User.isStoreAdmin`):
- `MarketplaceProduct` — `name`, `category` (TEXT code validated against `MARKETPLACE_CATEGORIES` — `BAT`, `GLOVES`, `THIGH_GUARD`, `PADS`, `HELMET`, `PROTECTION`, `BALL`, `KIT_BAG`, `SHOES`, `ACCESSORY` — so a new category is a code change, not a migration), `brand`, `sku`, `description`, `price`, `mrp` (strike-through; must be ≥ price), `stockQty` (null = untracked), `inStock`, `isActive` (**published**; new products start hidden so photos can be added first), `isFeatured`, `displayOrder`, `sizes String[]` (chips — "SH", "Harrow"), `specs Json` (`[{label, value}]`), `createdById`. Validated by `ProductInputSchema`; PATCH takes the **complete** product like the ledger.
- `MarketplaceProductImage` — the photo **bytes in Postgres** (`Bytes`), plus sniffed `contentType`, `sizeBytes`, `width`/`height` (read from the container headers, no image library), `sortOrder` (0 = primary). Served by `GET /api/shop/images/[id]` with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable` — a row is never edited, only replaced (delete + upload = new id), so the id is a safe forever-cache key. **Never select `data` in a list query**; `PRODUCT_IMAGE_META_SELECT` in `src/lib/marketplace-server.ts` is the metadata-only select. Uploads go through `readImageUpload` (multipart `file`, type decided by magic bytes not the declared header, ≤ `MARKETPLACE_LIMITS.maxImageBytes` = 3 MB, ≤ 8 per product, the cap enforced in a serializable transaction) after the browser has downsized them with `prepareImageForUpload` (`src/lib/image-resize.ts`, longest edge 1600px, EXIF orientation baked in, PNG → JPEG fallback and quality/dimension step-down until the blob fits the cap). All storage access sits in `marketplace-server.ts` so a move to an object store (Vercel Blob) is a change there, not in the routes.
- `MarketplaceInterest` — unique `(productId, userId)`, cascade-deleted with the product.
- `UserAddress` — **global**, like the store: `label`, `fullName`, `phone` (normalised 10-digit), `line1`/`line2`/`landmark`, `city`, `state`, `pincode`, `isDefault`. Up to `MAX_ADDRESSES_PER_USER` (5); the first one is the default automatically, the default can only be *moved* (never unset) and deleting it promotes the oldest remaining. Every write runs through `runSerializable` (`src/lib/serializable-tx.ts`) with the ownership read **inside** the transaction. Managed on **`/profile`** through `/api/user/addresses` (+`/[id]`); the schema is `AddressInputSchema` in `src/lib/addresses.ts` (pure).

**Routes**: public `GET /api/shop/status`, `GET /api/shop/products` (published only, per-category counts, offset-paged 24 at a time with `total` / `hasMore` — the `/shop` grid appends pages with "Load more"), `GET /api/shop/products/[id]`, `POST|DELETE /api/shop/products/[id]/interest` (signed-in; answers a JSON 401 rather than the middleware's HTML redirect because `/api/shop` is on the public list), `GET /api/shop/images/[id]`. Store-admin `GET|POST /api/admin/shop/products`, `GET|PATCH|DELETE …/[id]`, `POST|PATCH …/[id]/images` (upload / reorder), `DELETE …/[id]/images/[imageId]`, `GET|PUT /api/admin/shop/settings`.

**Key files**: `src/lib/marketplace.ts` (catalog, config, Zod, WhatsApp link/message helpers, `buildShareText`, image sniffing, `STORE_NAME` / `STORE_NAV_LABEL`), `src/lib/marketplace-server.ts` (Prisma selects/mappers, config resolution, image storage), `src/lib/marketplace-seo.ts` (share-card metadata), `src/lib/kis-showcase.ts` (the one-bat copy: `KIS_MODEL`, `KIS_HIGHLIGHTS`, `KIS_STEPS`, photo picks, `isKisModel`) + the generated `src/lib/kis-photos.ts`, `src/lib/addresses.ts`, `src/lib/marketplace-status.tsx`, `src/components/shop/` (`ProductCard` — the one tile used by `/shop` and the landing page — `ProductImage`, `ShopBadges` incl. `PreBookBadge` / `OpenBadge`, gallery/detail/list clients, `LandingShopSection`, `MarketplacePromoBanner`, `KisSpotlight` / `KisMarquee` / `KisHighlights` / `KisHowItWorks`, `ShareButton`, `StoreSocialLinks`), `src/app/shop/`, `src/app/admin/shop/page.tsx`, `src/components/admin/shop/`, `scripts/kis-creatives/` (showcase photo prep, the landing video render, the share card).

### Profile (`/profile`)

Every signed-in user can open their profile from the Navbar's profile icon and the bottom nav's **Profile** tab and edit it there: **name** (`ProfileNameEditor`, validated by `normalizeDisplayName`), **email** (`ProfileEmailEditor`, validated by `normalizeEmail` in `src/lib/email.ts` — add, change, or remove; the API refuses to clear the email of an account with no mobile number, since it would then be reachable by nothing) and **delivery addresses** (see above). All three write through `PATCH /api/user/profile` / `/api/user/addresses`, and both ends validate with the same pure modules so the form and the API cannot disagree. The mobile number is the login and is **not** editable here — it changes only through an OTP-verified flow. An email set here is unique across accounts (409 on a clash), because legacy Google accounts are keyed on it.

### Per-center Razorpay (phase 6)

Each `Center` row may store its own `razorpayKeyId`, `razorpayKeySecret`, and `razorpayWebhookSecret`. When set, every Razorpay operation for that center routes to its own merchant account; centers without keys fall back to the env (`RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` / `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` / `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET`).

**Helpers in `src/lib/razorpay.ts`**:
- `getCenterRazorpayCredentials(centerId)` — returns `{ keyId, keySecret, webhookSecret, fromEnvFallback }` or null.
- `getRazorpayInstanceForCenter(centerId)` — cached SDK client per center (keyed by `centerId`, env fallback under `__env__`).
- `createRazorpayOrder({ centerId, amount, receipt, notes })` — adds `centerId` to order notes automatically.
- `verifyPaymentSignatureForCenter({ centerId, ... })` — looks up secret + verifies HMAC.
- `verifyPaymentSignatureWithSecret({ keySecret, ... })` — sync version when caller already has the secret.
- `verifyWebhookSignatureWithSecret({ body, signature, webhookSecret })` — webhook-side HMAC.
- `initiateRefund({ centerId, paymentId, amount, notes })` — refunds against the originating center's account.
- `fetchPaymentDetails(centerId, paymentId)` — fetch via the center's account.

The legacy `getRazorpayInstance()` and `verifyPaymentSignature(...)` are deprecated env-only shims kept for any unmigrated callers.

**Webhook routing** (`/api/webhooks/razorpay`): all centers point their dashboards at the same URL. The handler reads the body, looks up the local `Payment` row by `razorpayOrderId` to identify the center, then verifies the signature with that center's webhook secret (env fallback if unset). Without a valid signature the request is rejected; without a matching Payment row the webhook returns `no_record` (200 OK so Razorpay doesn't retry).

**Client init** (`/api/payments/config`): returns `razorpayKeyId` resolved from the user's current center, with env fallback. The client uses this to bootstrap Razorpay Checkout against the right merchant account.

**Configuration UI**: super admin → `/admin/centers/[id]` → Payment tab. Secrets are masked on read and only re-sent when the admin types a new value.

### Center-scoped data — current state
| Table | Scope | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Booking, Slot, BlockedSlot | center | unique on `(centerId, …)` |
| Package, UserPackage | center via Package | `Package.centerId` is authoritative; `UserPackage` derives via join |
| Payment, Refund | center | per-center Razorpay account |
| LedgerEntry | center | manual revenue + expenses; `(centerId, kind, entryDate)` index |
| **MarketplaceProduct, MarketplaceProductImage, MarketplaceInterest** | **global** | the Cricket Store — one catalog for all of PlayOrbit; run by `User.isStoreAdmin` / super admins, never center admins |
| **UserAddress** | **global** | delivery addresses on `/profile`; one default per user |
| **Wallet, WalletTransaction** | **center** | `(userId, centerId)` unique; per-center balances; refunds at center X credit user's center-X wallet only |
| PromotionalOffer, RecurringSlotDiscount | center | |
| OperatorAssignment, CashPaymentUser | center | |
| Policy / CenterPolicy | global default + per-center override | use `getPolicyValue(key, centerId)` |
| User, Notification, Otp | global | a single user spans centers via `CenterMembership` |

A `WALLET_SCOPE` policy ('CENTER' | 'GLOBAL') is reserved for future use — wallets stay per-center for now. To switch to global wallets later: relax `Wallet.centerId` to nullable, add a resolver that picks the right wallet based on the policy, and migrate existing per-center balances into a single global row per user.
